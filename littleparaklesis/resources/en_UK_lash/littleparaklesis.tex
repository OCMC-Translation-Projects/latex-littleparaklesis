August in Constantinople was a month of disease and pestilence and so it was the custom to carry the True Cross in procession through all the quarters of the City during the first two weeks of the month. The office for the first of the month still commemorates this practice, as does the solemn blessing of Holy Water, which is performed in many churches on that day, although it is the normal Orthodox custom to do so on the first of every month. In Greek use it is the custom to sing the Office of Supplication to the Mother of God each evening during the first fortnight of August. This may well be a survival of the ancient practice in an adapted form.
%</"p0006">
%<*"p0007">
In present practice the two Canons, the Great and the Little, are sung on alternate evenings, but since the Typikon of the Great Church does not prescribe the office for the 1st, in many places the Little Canon is sung on the 2nd and the Great on the 3rd and so forth. The full rite supposes that the office is sung at Vespers immediately after the Song of Symeon, ‘Now, Master’. It is the custom in many monasteries of the Holy Mountain and elsewhere to sing the Canon of the Mother of God from the Theotokarion, with its Prosomia, each weekday evening at this point of Vespers. The Canons of Supplication replace this during the first fortnight of August.
%</"p0007">
%<*"p0008">
Use of this office is not confined to the first fortnight of August, and so the two forms of the office are given here. It is the equivalent of the Slav Molieben, but Greek use has never reduced the Canon simply to the refrains between the troparia, omitting the troparia themselves, as in the common Slav use. The Canon itself is used as the first canon at Matins for those feasts of Saints on which the Paraklitiki is not used and which do not have a special canon to the Mother of God.
%</"p0008">
%<*"p0009">
The present translation has been made in such a way that it can be sung to the standard Byzantine melodies and so the text has been laid out in accordance with the metrical structure of the original. When the texts are set out as prose, the current Greek books use commas to indicate musical punctuation; a confusing practice, since commas are also used for ordinary punctuation of the text. The use of the monastery of Grottaferrata was to indicate the metrical structure with asterisks, and a number of modern Greek books have adopted this. The hymn ‘It is truly right’ and its Megalynarion, ‘Greater in honour’, which are taken from the official translation of the Divine Liturgy of the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, do not fit exactly to the melody, but can be sung quite easily without written music by an experienced singer.
%</"p0009">
%<*"p0010">
Clearly certain liberties have had to be taken with the text in order to fit the translation to the strict musical forms of the original, but we believe that no ideas have been introduced which are not in the original and we have tried to limit additions to standard epithets and occasional synonymous expansions. The work of translation has been done by Archimandrite Ephrem and David Melling. David Melling has done all the work on the music, which is also available. We hope in time to publish similar versions of the Great Canon of Supplication and of the Office of the Akathist to the Mother of God.
%</"p0010">
%<*"p0011">
It should be noted that the Office of Supplication is celebrated for the living, and the departed should not be commemorated in the litanies.
%</"p0011">
%<*"p0012">
The icon of the Gorgoÿpikoos, ’She Who Responds Quickly’, Proctectress of the Monastery of Docheiariou on the Holy Mountain, was painted for Archimandrite Ephrem by Monk Silouan of the Monastery of St Arsenios in Chalkidiki. This icon is an icon of the Mother of God ’Hodegitria’, in whose honour the service is sung, as the penultimate Megalynarion makes clear.

Lord, hear my prayer; in your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant, for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled my life to the ground; made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit in me grew weary, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated on all your works. I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you; my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name’s sake, O Lord, you will give me life. In your justice you will bring my soul out of trouble; in your mercy slay my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant.

Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassions blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it. You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit. A broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure, and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of justice, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar.

n those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Juda, and she entered the house of Zachary and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, ‘Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For see, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.’ And Mary said, ‘My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold, from henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name. And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her own house.
