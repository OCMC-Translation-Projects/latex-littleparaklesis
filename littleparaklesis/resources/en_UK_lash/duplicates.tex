Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

Brethren, Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he lives, he lives unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

%<*"d0214">
Brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant about those who have fallen asleep, so that you may not grieve like the rest who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so too God will bring with him those who sleep through Jesus. We tell you this by the Lord's word, that we who are left alive at the Lord's coming will by no means precede those sleep. Because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, at the voice of an Archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are left alive will be snatched up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall all be with the Lord.

Have mercy on me O God, in your great mercy; according to the fullness of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you only I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words, and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived, and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth: you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed; you will wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with a sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed, and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will declare your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it; you will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of justice, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar.

At the end, after "The rich have become poor ...," the Singers begin "Blessed be the name of the Lord..." as usual; and the Liturgy ends in the normal way. If there is a Memorial Service for the Departed it takes place immediately after "The rich have become poor...," and is followed by "Blessed be the name of the Lord."

The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him, \u2018Amen, Amen I say to you, that one who hears my word and believes in him who sent me has eternal life; and is not coming to judgement, but has passed over from death to life. Amen, Amen I say to you that the hour is coming and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who have heard will live. For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to Son to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to deliver judgement also, because he is son of man. Do not marvel at this; because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice; and they will come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, but those who have done ill to the resurrection of judgement. I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgement is just; because I do not seek my will, but the will of the Father who sent me.'
